Libraries and their purpose
- @testing-library/react
  - uses ReactDOM to render a component for testing
- @testing-library/user-event
  - Helps simulate user input like typing and clicking
- @testing-library/ReactDOM
  - Helps find elements that are rendered by our components
- Jest
  - Runs our tests, reports results.
  - It's responsible for collection all of our test files and executing them.
  - Jest finds all files in the src folder that ends with .spec.js, .test.js or files placed in a __test__ folder.
- jsdom
  - Simulates a browser when running in a Node environment.

What happens when we run our tests?
- whenever we run our tests, they are being executed in a nodejs environment.
- whenever we render our component by using our render() a fake browser environment is created by a library called JSDOM.
- our component is render, html is taken from it and used by the fake browser environment.
- after we've used render we can access elements in this environmentusing the "screen object"

What is the word "Role" in testing referring to. (ARIA ROLES)
- it refers to a aria "Role" aka the purpose of an HTML elements.
- traditionally used by screen readers - softwares to help people understand the content on the screen.
- many HTML element have a "implicit" or automatically assigned role.
- elements can be assigned manually a role. Even trained engineers do this incorrectly.

Elements and their ARIA ROLES
- Role selection is the primary way REACT testing library wants you use to find elements
- "heading" - H1, H2, H3, H4, H5, H6
- "list" - ul, li
- "button" - button
- "link" - a
- "textbox" input

Different types of Matches
- Jest example matches - normally for general purpose things, can be really used on any JS code
  - expect(["a", "b"]).toHaveLength(2) - Makes sure the value is an array with a particular length.
  - expect(5).toEqual(5) - Makes sure the value equals another value.
  - expect(["a", "b", "x"]).toContain("b") - Makes sure an array contains a value, or make sure a string contains another string.
  - expect(fn).toThrow(2) - Makes sure functions throws an error when called.
  - expect(mock).toHaveBeenCalled() - Makes sure a mock fucntion has been called.
- React Testing library
  - expect(element).toBeInDocument() - Makes sure an element is present on the page.
  - expect(element).toBeEnabled() - Makes sure an element (like an input) is not disabled.
  - expect(element).toHaveClass() - Makes sure an element has a class name.
  - expect(element).toHaveTextContent() - Makes sure an element has some particular text.
  - expect(element).toHaveValue() - Makes sure an input, select or textarea has a value.
  
Mock functions
- mocks as in not a real function.
- it records whenever it gets called, and the arguments it was called with. (like internal storage)
- used very often when we need to make sure a component calls a callback
